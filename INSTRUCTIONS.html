    <h2>Before Starting</h2>

    <p>The goals of this exercise are to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Expose you to real problems that you will be expected to solve daily</li>
        <li>Test your ability to write clean, conventional Rails code</li>
        <li>Test your ability to write well-architected, performant code</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You should approach this project as if it was going to go
        into production on a high-traffic website where millions of dollars are
        flowing through the system. Indeed, we are interested in seeing what
        your standard is for a project like this from a professional
        engineering perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        We expect that, excluding time taken to set up your system, you should be
        able to comfortably complete this exercise in roughly 3 to 6 hours.
        You should go as fast as you can <u>without sacrificing quality in the submission</u>.
         We would like to get a complete submission even if it takes a
        bit longer than expected or if you want to work on it in parts. To that
        end you have up to 3 days after receiving the project to finish. As
        a benchmark, our solution took less than 3 hours to complete in a single
        sitting and didn't need to extensively modify the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        We expect you to adhere to best-practices with regard to Rails/Ruby
        conventions, architecture, and patterns. We encourage you to research
        your solution if you aren't sure of the best-practice. Feel free to
        use any resources available to you.
    </p>

    <h2>System Requirements & Setup</h2>

    <p>
      This project requires Ruby 2.3.0 and Postgres 9.5.X to be installed on your system. If you're not familiar with
      how to install Postgres, check out
      <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresql">this article</a>.
    </p>

    <p>To get started, change into the project's root directory and install all dependencies:</p>

    <!-- @formatter:off -->
    <pre><code>bundle install</code></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->

    <p>Next, change your Postgres username and password in the <span><code>database.yml</code></span> file to
        the appropriate settings for your system.</p>

    <p>Now, create and migrate the database:</p>

    <!-- @formatter:off -->
    <pre><code>rake db:create; rake db:migrate; rake db:seed</code></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->

    <p>Since we have removed the root git repository from the app, your final task should be to initialize
        one and make your first commit.</p>

    <!-- @formatter:off -->
    <pre><code>git init; git add .; git commit</code></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->

    <p>
      At this point you should be good to go! If you run into any issues getting set up, please let us know ASAP.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      In a hypothetical world about 65 million years after the extinction of
      the dinosaurs, there exists a company called Man Crates that has built a
      rapidly-growing e-commerce business.
    </p>

    <p>
      Up until now they've been handling fulfillment manually, keeping track of
      stock on a spreadsheet and updating and tracking orders by hand. Man
      Crates wants to start automating the fulfillment process to improve
      efficiency, eliminate human error and improve customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <h3>#1: Order Form</h3>

    <p>
      To get started, we'd like to create an order form that lets customer
      service enter orders on behalf of the customer. This form should let a
      customer service representative select a product, enter a customer name,
      and then click a button to create the order. Here's the mockups for the
      form:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/48B5XKIMR#/screens/227424199'>Desktop</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/PRB5YP9JN#/screens/227410653'>Mobile</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll need to create an <span><code>Order</code></span> model to implement this form.
      In addition to the product and customer name, <span><code>Order</code></span> should
      have a <span><code>status</code></span> attribute that's initially set to
      <span><code>processing</code></span> and a <span><code>created_at</code></span> date.
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things simple, you can assume that each <span><code>Order</code></span> has only
      one <span><code>Product</code></span>. We've also created the <span><code>Product</code></span> model
      for you already!
    </p>

    <h3>#2: Admin Order Search</h3>

    <p>
      Various folks within the company need to browse orders to handle
      customer support requests, debug the system, or analyze the business. To
      that end, we want to give them the ability to easily search for orders
      and filter them based on various criteria.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'd like to build this interface using a server-generated page. We've
      created two small mockups for the view:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://invis.io/48B5XKIMR'>Desktop</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://invis.io/PRB5YP9JN'>Mobile</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><span class="tip"><code>TIP:</code></span>
      We don't want to let anyone outside the company view the orders
      dashboard. <b>Choose and implement a method to secure the order search
      page. You can use any method you want, but be sure to comment about any
    shortcomings of the method you choose.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>#3: Automatic Shipping Status Updates</h3>

    <p>
      Man Crates ships its products to customers via FedEx, which has an API to
      check the status of a particular shipment. We want to make sure that
      every order has the correct shipping status at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a order is processed, folks at the distribution center pack it all
      up and set it up for shipping by getting an ID from FedEx and slapping a
      label with said ID on the box. FedEx comes by once a day to pick up all
      orders that are awaiting pickup, magically moves them all over the
      country, and eventually delivers them to our customers' front doors.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to check the status of each open order every 15 minutes. Because
      this involves querying a third-party API, it's a good use case for an
      asynchronous process, which means we're going to use ActiveJob.
    </p>

    <p>
      We've created a stub job already. <b>You should implement the
      <span><code>perform</code></span> method:</b>
    </p>

    <!-- @formatter:off -->
    <pre><code>
    class UpdateShippingStatusJob < ActiveJob::Base
        def perform
            # IMPLEMENT ME
        end
    end
    </code></pre>
    <!-- @formatter:on -->


    <p>
      You can assume that an order transitions through the following states on
      the FedEx side: <span><code>awaiting_pickup</code></span>,
      <span><code>in_transit</code></span>,
      <span><code>out_for_delivery</code></span>, and
      <span><code>delivered</code></span>. You should use the same names in your
      code.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also assume that any order not in the
      <span><code>processing</code></span> state (the default state) will have
      a valid <span><code>fedex_id</code></span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We've implemented a FedEx client library in
      <span><code>lib/fedex.rb</code></span> already for you, which you should
      use to get an order's current shipping status from FedEx. You should also
      use this library to create a shipment for an order if the shipment
      doesn't exist. Here's the <a href='doc/Fedex.html'>documentation</a> for
      <span><code>lib/fedex.rb</code></span>.
    </p>

    <p><span class="tip"><code>TIP:</code></span>
      Think about how to write the job in a way that is memory-efficient and
      performant. It could easily be the case that there are tends of thousands
      of orders that require shipping status updates at any given time.
    </p>

    <p><span class="tip"><code>TIP:</code></span>
      <b>You shouldn't directly modify this <code>lib/fedex.rb</code>, despite any
      shortcomings.</b> Instead find other ways to ensure that the
      <span><code>perform</code></span> method can handle whatever cases might
      arise from using <span><code>lib/fedex.rb</code></span>
